# MARVELousapp

This project was firstly bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app),
then I ejected from the bootstrap and created based on the regular one.

## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Also, react-native is required to run the app.

## Run
```
react-native run-ios
```

```
react-native run-android
```
